# Flood Detection and Avoidance

# Project Overview
Flood Detection and Avoidance is an IoT-based project designed to **monitor water levels in real-time** and trigger preventive actions to minimize flood damage. The system uses sensors to collect environmental data and alerts authorities or residents when flood risk thresholds are exceeded.

# Features
- Real-time water level monitoring using ultrasonic sensors
- Rainfall detection with rain gauge sensors
- Automatic alerts via SMS or email
- Data visualization through dashboards
- Control signals to activate pumps or flood barriers for prevention

# Tech Stack
- **Hardware:** Arduino / Raspberry Pi, Ultrasonic Sensor, Rain Gauge Sensor
- **Software:** Python, C/C++
- **Communication:** GSM Module / Wi-Fi
- **Cloud / Dashboard:** ThingSpeak / Blynk for data visualization

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
