# Flood-Detection-and-Avoidance
This project aims to detect potential flood risks in real-time and trigger preventive measures to minimize damage. It uses sensor data (water level, rainfall intensity, humidity, and temperature) combined with data processing algorithms to monitor environmental conditions and issue alerts.
